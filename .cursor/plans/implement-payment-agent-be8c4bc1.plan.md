# Plan: Verify Browser Profile Integration

This plan confirms that the payment agent is already correctly configured to use the Chromium profile specified in your environment variables. This is the key to bypassing login screens on sites like Amazon.

### How It Works

The `PurchaseAgent` class in `agentic/payment_agent.py` is hardcoded to look for the `BROWSEROS_PROFILE_PATH` environment variable. It reads this path and passes it as a command-line argument (`--user-data-dir`) when Playwright launches the Chromium instance.

This is the exact code block responsible for this behavior:

```python:47:61:agentic/payment_agent.py
        # Get profile path from env or parameter
        self.profile_path = profile_path or os.getenv(
            'BROWSEROS_PROFILE_PATH',
            '/Users/carruc/Library/Application Support/BrowserOS/walled-agent'
        )
        
        # Configure browser settings
        self.browser_config = BrowserConfig(
            headless=headless,
            disable_security=False,
            extra_chromium_args=[
                f'--user-data-dir={self.profile_path}',
                '--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled',  # Anti-detection
                '--no-first-run',
                '--no-default-browser-check',
            ]
        )
```

### Conclusion

Since the functionality is already in place, no code modifications are necessary. The plan is simply to ensure your environment is set up correctly.

### To-dos

- [ ] Review `agentic/payment_agent.py` to confirm it reads the `BROWSEROS_PROFILE_PATH` environment variable.
- [ ] Ensure the `.env` file is present and contains the correct `BROWSEROS_PROFILE_PATH`.
